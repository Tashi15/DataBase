1. 

Evidence looks ok.

You could have joined the screenshots for better organization.


2.

Sufficient knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey.

The distinction between a superkey and candidate key is not sufficiently
discussed. Remember that a candidate key is the minimum set of superkeys. 


3.

You show a table, yet you do not discuss it, what is it? What are you trying to
say with it?

You do did not talk about data types in SQL, you just mention some common sense
data types in computing, e.g., floating point, character. In SQL these are
NUMERIC, CHAR, etc.

You did not discuss what fields were -nullable-.


4.

The ``frist normal form'' has nothing to do with primary keys. Please check
your notes and the textbook Chapter 6.1.

The ``access rows by content only'' rule explanation is wrong. Please check
your notes or the book Chapter 6.1.
