Correct SQL statements
Correct output for some queries
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  select * from products where city not in ('Dallas', 'Duluth') and priceUSD >= 1;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city NOT IN ('Dallas', 'Duluth')
    AND priceUSD >= 1;



9. List all orders from the customer whose cid is C005.

Incorrect output
- You are not listing the orders, but customer info!


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
